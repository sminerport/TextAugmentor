CHAPTER 2The carpet bag.I stuffed one or two shirts into my old carpet bag, put them under myArm and launched to Cape Horn and into the Pacific. GoodbyeCity of old Manhattan, I duly arrived in New Bedford.Saturday night in December. I was very disappointed when I learnedThat the packet for Nantucket had already left and that noWay there, until the following Monday.How Most Young Candidates Quit the Pain and Punishments of WhalingAt this same new Bedford, from there embarking on their voyage, it may be asFor one thing, I had no idea I was doing this.It was decided not to sail in any other than a Nantucket boat because:There was a fine, impetuous something about everything that came with itWith this famous old island, which made me amazingly happy.New Bedford has lately gradually gained a monopoly on theBusiness with whaling, and although in this matter poor old NantucketNow there's a long way to go, but Nantucket was her big original - the tireOf this Carthage; --the place where the first dead American whale wasStranded. Where else but Nantucket did these Native Americans live?The whalers, the Red Men, first set off in canoes to chase the whales.Leviathan? And where, other than Nantucket, did that happen first?Adventurous small sloop, which is partly loaded with imported goodsTo throw cobblestones - so the story goes - at the whales in order toDiscover when they were close enough to risk a harpoon out of the water.Bow sprit?Now we have one night, one day and another night beforeBefore I could make my way to my destination in New Bedford,Became a matter of concern about where to eat and sleepMeanwhile. It was a very dubious looking, yes, a very dark andGloomy night, biting cold and carefree. I didn't know anyone in the world.Place. With anxious grapplers I had reached into my pocket, and onlyAnd wherever you go, Ishmael, I have brought you a few pieces of silver.I said to myself as I stood in the middle of a desolate street.I shoulder my bag and compare the gloom to the north.The darkness to the south - wherever you in your wisdomTo spend the night, my dear Ishmael, inquire,The price, and do not be too specific.With stopped steps I walked through the streets and passed the sign "DieCrossed Harpoons "- but it looked too expensive and too funny.From the bright red windows of the "Sword-Fish-Inn" it continues.Came so glowing rays, that it seemed as ifSnow and ice packed in front of the house, because everywhere elseSolidified frost lay ten centimetres thick in a hard, asphaltPlaster, --for me pretty exhausted when I put my foot against thePebble projections, because of hard, relentless service the solesMy boots were in an extremely wretched position.Cheerfully, I thought again, pausing for a moment to observe the wide bright lightOn the street and hear the sounds of the clanking glasses inside.But again, Ishmael, I finally said; don't you hear that? Out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis, out of the crisis.In front of the door; your patched boots block the way.I now instinctively followed the roads that led me downstream,For there were undoubtedly the cheapest, if not the most cheerful, inns.Such dreary roads! Blocks of blackness, not houses, on bothHand, and here and there a candle, like a candle, whichGrave. At this hour of the night, on the last day of the week,Neighborhoods of the city turned out to be virtually deserted. But I immediately came to the following conclusion:A smoking light emanating from a low, wide building whose doorWas invitingly open. It looked carefree as if it was meant to beFor use by the public; so the first thing I did when I came in wasTo stumble over an ash box in the veranda. Ha! I thought, ha, when theThe flying particles almost suffocated me, are these ashes from theRuined city, Gomorrah? But "The Crossed Harpoons" and "TheSwordfish? " - that has to be the sign of "The Trap."However, I picked myself up and heard a loud voice inside me, urging meAnd opened a second interior door.It seemed as if the great Black Parliament was sitting in Tophet.Black faces that turned in their rows to look; and beyond that a black faceAngel of Fate struck a book on a pulpit. It was a Negro church;And the text of the preacher was about darkness, and theWeeping, weeping and gnashing of teeth. Ha, Ishmael, mutteredI, who withdrew, provided miserable entertainment under the banner of "The trap!"As I walked on, I finally came to a dull light, not far from theDocks and heard a deserted creak in the air; and when he looked up, he saw aSwinging sign above the door with a white livery on it, faintedRepresenting a high, straight stream of misty spray, and these wordsTitled "The Spouter Inn: --Peter Coffin."Coffin? --Spouter? --Rather ominous in this particular context,I thought. But it's a common name in Nantucket, they say, and ISuppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.Looked so dark, and the place looked quiet enough for the time, andThe run-down wooden cottage itself looked as if it hadWere carted here from the ruins of a burnt-out district, and when theThe swinging shield had a poor kind of creak, I thought.That this was the place for cheap accommodation, and the best of peasCoffee.It was a strange place - an old house with a gable, one sideWeakened, it seemed, and sadly stooped. It stood on a sharpDark corner, where this stormy wind Euroclydon a worseThere was more howling than ever over poor Paul's discarded craft. Euroklydon,Nevertheless, there is a mighty pleasant zephyr to every in-house, withHis feet on the stove toast the bed softly. "In assessing whatStormy wind called Euroclydon, "says an old writer, whoseWorks that I own, the only surviving copy - "it makes a wonderfulDifference between looking at it from a glass window, whereThe frost is on the outside, or if you observe it from the outside,The sliding window, in which the frost is on both sides and from whichWise death is the only glazier. " True enough, I thought, asThat passage came to mind - old black letter, you most sensibleGood. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is theHouse. Pity they didn't stop the columns and plottingAnd thrust in a little fluff here and there.Too late to make any improvements now. The universe is ready; theCopestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.Poor Lazarus there, rattling his teeth against the curb forHis pillow, and shakes off his shreds with his trembling, he couldStuffs both ears with rags and puts a corn cob in his mouth, andBut that wouldn't stop tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroklydon!Says the old diver in his red silk wrap -- (he had a redderAfter) Phew, phew! What a beautiful frosty night; like OrionGlitters; what aurora borealis! Let them talk about their orientalSummer climate of eternal conservatories; give me the privilege,To make my own summer with my own coals.But what does Lazarus think? Can he keep his blue hands warm by holding them?Up to the Great Northern Lights? Wouldn't Lazarus rather be inSumatra than here? Wouldn't he rather put it down lengthwise?Along the equatorial line; yes, gods! Down into the fiery pitTo keep out this frost?Now that Lazarus was supposed to be stranded there on the curb,The door of the dives, this is more wonderful than an icebergOn one of the Moluccas. But if he dives himself, he too livesLike a tsar in an ice palace of frozen sighs and aPresident of a moderate society, he drinks only the lukewarm tears ofOrphans.But now the bubbling is over, we go whaling, and thereThere is still plenty of that. Let's scrape the ice off ourFrozen feet, and see what kind of place this "spouter" may be.
