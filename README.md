# Text Augmentation using Back-Translation

This repository contains a Python script that leverages the NLPAug library and round-trip translation (RTT) technique to augment text datasets. The script processes TXT files in the "data/" folder, translating text to another language and back, creating augmented versions. The augmented dataset enhances training data for natural language processing tasks like chatbot training or text classification. The repository includes a brief overview of text augmentation techniques, applications, and Python code for implementing the back-translation augmenter.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your local machine.

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sminerport/back-translation-text-augmentation.git
```

Navigate to the back-translation-text-augmentation folder:

```bash
cd back-translation-text-augmentation
```

Next, you'll need to install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary packages and their specific versions as listed in the requirements.txt file, ensuring compatibility with the script.
